          <p>My piece focuses on the rhetoric of whether to go through with a prank. I chose this as the topic for my multimedia narrative because it is exciting as a narrative yet also full of rhetoric. Its multimodal nature also lets itself very well to the project and it was natural to turn my story into a blog post with interactive content.</p>

          <p> I chose to make my narrative multimodal by turning it into a “blog post” with text, images, and interactions relevant to the story. One of the focuses of my story is messing with another students laptop in order to change the images of a website. I was able to mirror this in my project by having a button which does just that on the readers computer. This helps show my audience exactly what I did and how disruptive and comical it was. This decision was effective because it causes the audience to better understand the story, thus investing themselves in my decision of whether to go through with it. They can see the direct result of my decision in the moments I was deciding whether to go through with my plan.
</p>
<p>
  In the story, I employ rhetoric when determining whether or not to go through with the prank. Because I am responsible for hitting the switch, my friends try to appeal to me using logos and pathos. Meanwhile, I also think to myself and use similar tactics to bat away my conscience. I also use rhetoric when discussing with my friends about how to create a better version of the prank. We are all appealing to each others sense of humor, and by bouncing ideas off each other we arrive at the best outcome. By using my skills as a rhetor, I was able to weigh my own doubts and my friend’s opinions before coming to a well deliberated decision.
