          <p>The only thing I learned in four years of health class is the power of boredom. Its an emotion delivered in surplus by the result of state requirements and a ever declining budget. Senior year is all about mental health, and what better way to inform adults about such a relevant and ever present topic than having them listen to Youtube videos and copy sentences out of a textbook. Sitting in the back, I didn’t see my teacher calmly stroll into the empty classroom across the hall before finding his way into the health room only 5 minutes after the bell had rang. “Alright everyone, let’s pass up the homework, or uh ya know what, just raise it in the air so I can see it.” He read down the list of names, butchering the same syllables he'd read hundreds of times, looking up briefly to see packets raised lackadaisically in the air. My friend sitting next to me pulled out the same crinkled packet he completed on the first day of class, and raised it up before handing it off to the next of my friends in the alphabet.
</p>

          <p>Next on the docket is some web activity. We take out our chromebooks, cumbersome 500 dollar internet machines that are childproofed in thick plastic, but guaranteed to break at the hinge within six months. Every student is given one by the school, and using your own laptop isn’t allowed. My friends and I took ours out and decided what game we will play whilst pretending to do our work. As we searched through google for unblocked websites, my friend Matt got up to go to the bathroom. The remaining four guys seized this opportunity to play a small prank on him. At the time there was a growing practice of installing humorous chrome extensions on others chromebooks. The google web store has thousands of these small gags available ranging in severity; some will summon a small Shia LaBeouf in the corner of the screen to yell at you to “Just do it”, while others replace words or images within webpages. I watched as they searched through practically endless options and raced to install one before he returned. I was immediately interested and thought about how to take the prank one step further. 
</p>

<p>They had successfully turned every image on matts laptop into Nicholas cage when I started forming an idea in my head. “So the images never show what they were originally?” I asked my friends. 
</p>
<p>“Nah it's just stuck like this forever until he uninstalls it”, Nathan said hunched over Matt's computer.
</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better if it was on a timer, so halfway through everything just suddenly switches over?”, I implored.</p>
<p>“Better yet, what if we could turn it on from our computer?” another one of my friends chimed in.
</p>
<p>By the time Matt had come back to his desk, no one even bothered to look at his reaction. We all were too busy searching furiously through the webstore, figuring out if there was an extension that could do what we envisioned. One by one we came up empty. But I wasn’t dissuaded yet. Instead I looked up the source code for one of these prank extensions. As I opened the file, I grinned. These extensions were just small javascript files that got appended to websites. The one I had looked at was literally one line.

</p>
<p>I began scheming. “Guys, I think I can write one myself. I can definitely write one myself. Nate, Look up how much it costs to publish a chrome extension” I was worried that publishing an extension would cost a lot. Apple charges a hefty $99 for the privilege of using their online store. 
</p>
<p>After a few seconds he chuckled, “it's only 5 dollars” And so I sat in the back of health class, punching in my debit card and laughing away as my invention came to life. Before the class was over, I had completed the extension and uploaded it to the webstore. The entire thing was dead simple. I went to a website on my computer with just one button. With one click, every image on victim's computer would turn into one of my choosing. Click again, and everything was back to normal. 
</p>
<p>The next health class me and my friends decided on who our target would be. After debating for a few minutes, we decided on Nora. Nora was the stereotypical overachiever student of our grade. She would spend hours on projects that most students would do the night before and study all night for quizzes that I wouldn’t even have remembered about. As a result, she was clear valedictorian from early senior year. But even more important, she was the most gullible person in the entire school. We would constantly feed her disinformation just to see her reaction. Once someone had convinced her that bottled water would go stale if you didn't drink it one day after opening it. Put simply, if the SAT tested street smarts, she wouldn’t be getting as many admission offers.
</p>
<p>My friends were already hyping our misgivious plan as best prank on Nora since freshman year. Being in almost all the same classes, it was too easy to get the extension on her computer. The day after our plan was made, Nora and I were in a group going over homework in calculus. 
</p>
<p>“Can I go to the bathroom?” she asks our teacher during class. Our teacher says yes and she leaves the room with her chromebook still open on the desk next to mine. I look over at Nate in the back of the class, and he mouths “Do it.” I nod and slide her computer onto my desk. I install my extension before subtly putting the computer back on her desk. The only thing left to do was wait for the perfect moment.
</p>
<p>That came weeks later during physics class. It had been two weeks since our plan’s inception and by now news of our prank had spread. Almost half of my classmates knew about the chrome extension on Nora’s chromebook, waiting to come to life. Our teacher had decided to make us give presentations on a lab we had done in class, and was choosing out of a hat who would go today. My teacher read the names one by one. “Cali, Ricky, Justin, and Nora.” Nate shot me a glare, and I returned one so that he would stop being so obvious. Of course I had heard Nora’s name, and that this was the time to finally turn on the extension. The prank had been so hilarious in my head only moments before, but now my stomach dipped as I envisioned the presentations to come.
</p>
<p>“Dude, I don’t know if I can do this” I said quietly to Nate.
</p>
<p>“What do you mean? You have to! We’ve been waiting weeks for this!”
</p>
<p>“I don’t know”, I repeated. I looked over at our teacher. “Mrs. Anderson, shes gonna kill me”
</p>
“It's just an image” he responded, trying to calm me. “She’ll probably find it funny too”
</p>
<p>I looked beyond nate at two other people in my class, staring back at me. They knew exactly what we were talking about. The best thing about a school with 400 people is that news travels way to fast. I hadn’t told more than 3 people outside of health, but it seemed as if everyone in the world but Nora knew what would happen during her presentation. I scrunched my face and comtemplated just bagging the whole thing.
</p>
<p><i>She’s gonna be so mad, don’t you know how much Nora cares about her grade? </i>I kept thinking. <i> It's just a little prank, it's not like she's gonna get anything other than an A anyways. Your going to get in so much trouble for such a dumb joke.</i> My mind was in turmoil.
</p>
<p>In health class, we learned about peer pressure and how those around you will cause you to make poor choices. That's not true. The real stinger is social pressure. It's not that your friends are going to force you to take 10 shots or ruin your valedictorians presentation or whatever, that's almost never the case. But with social situations comes social expectation, and you’re painfully aware of when your rubbing against the grain. I had a class of 30 kids, and they were told they were going to see a spectacle. I wasn’t about to disappoint them. 
</p>
<p>I closed my mind and opened my chromebook. I loaded up the page with that big button staring back at me. And I waited for Nora's turn to present, chromebook open, my mouse over the button as she began to lecture.
</p>
<p>My program would replace any image on screen with the one me and my friends decided on, so it was all about choosing a slide with lots of images. Being the overachiever she was, Nora had a slide on her presentation with a diagram of the setup, followed by about 4 equations and arrows between them. But physics equations are special in that almost every variable is a greek symbol. Nora had chosen to use pictures of the symbols in her slides because they look better, but they didn’t look better after I pressed my forefinger into my mousepad. 
</p>
<p>The small click of my chromebook sounded like a gunshot in the silent classroom. One by one, every single diagram, symbol, and arrow became replaced with the face of Mr. Bean. His wide smile appeared right under Nora’s pointing finger. His fat nose discredited her perfect derivation of the standing wave formula. And his bulging eyes stared through me.
</p>
<p>I thought that when I clicked that box I would look away, put on a poker face, and pretend like I hadn’t noticed a thing. But the hysterical laughter of the class got the better of me. Nate’s face hit his desk and my friend on my left was almost in tears. I covered my mouth, but my laughter was still audible. Nora hadn’t yet comprehended what had happened, and she broke her professional character to yelp out “what the hell” over the sea of laughter. Most surprising of all, my teacher simply smirked as she looked over the classroom. Perhaps after years of seeing predictable experiments and presentations, it was a relief to witness something unexpected.
</p>
<p>I was lucky to see a light hearted attitude by shared by both my teacher and Nora. After I set the images back to normal, she went on with her presentation as planned. Mrs. Anderson held me back after class, but simply told me never to do something like it again. I was more than happy to comply. 
</p>
<p>I know that I will someday again find myself in a similar situation. It's the result of having mind far more mischievous than my conscience. But I’m glad that I was able to reason my way through the situation and go through with the prank. If nothing else, It showed that sometimes there needs to be a little fun, even during the more serious parts of life.
